# BankingFun
This is a Java program that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation using a banking system as an example.

The program defines three classes: Account, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount. The Account class is the base class for the other two and defines basic functionality like depositing and withdrawing money from an account. SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount classes extend the Account class and add specific functionality like calculating interest and allowing overdrafts respectively.

The Bank class is also defined which manages a collection of accounts and provides methods for adding/removing accounts, getting the total balance of all accounts, and transferring money between accounts.

The main method in the BankingFun class creates a new Bank object and adds four different types of accounts to it. It then performs various operations on these accounts like withdrawing, depositing, and transferring money and prints the updated balances to the console.
